Simple Shell(1)                                                        Simple Shell(1)

NAME
       simple_shell - a simple UNIX command line interpreter

SYNOPSIS
       simple_shell

DESCRIPTION
       Simple Shell is a basic command line interpreter that allows users to execute simple
       commands. It handles single-word command lines without any advanced features like
       semicolons, pipes, or redirections.

USAGE
       Simple Shell displays a prompt and waits for the user to type a command. A command line
       always ends with a new line. The prompt is displayed again after each command execution.
       If an executable cannot be found, an error message is printed, and the prompt is displayed
       again. The shell handles errors gracefully, including the "end of file" condition (Ctrl+D).

OPTIONS
       Simple Shell has no command-line options.

COMMANDS
       The shell supports simple commands without arguments. It does not handle special characters
       like ", ', `, \, *, &, #.

       Supported built-ins:
           exit: Exits the shell. No arguments are accepted.
           env: Prints the current environment.

       Unsupported features:
           Path handling: The shell does not use the PATH to locate executables.
           Special characters: Special characters and advanced features are not supported.

EXAMPLES
       Interactive mode:
           $ ./simple_shell
           # /bin/ls
           hsh main.c shell.c
           #
           # exit
           $

       Non-interactive mode:
           $ echo "/bin/ls" | ./simple_shell
           hsh main.c shell.c
